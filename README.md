# Face_Recognition
Facial Expression Recognition using a lightweight CNN trained on the FER-2013 dataset. Detects emotions like happy, sad, and neutral from grayscale images. Uses OpenCV for preprocessing and TensorFlow/Keras for training. Optimized for small size (&lt;1GB), making it easy to run and deploy. Ideal for real-time applications and low-memory environments.
